Idea - Support NDC Codes

- instead of medication generics and manual entry, enter meds by ndc codes
- enter new packages purely by ndc code
- enter opened packaged by the 8or9-character ndc code (numbers before the last hyphen), then require manual entry of quantity information
- Custom medications can be entered via 8or9-character ndc codes (numbers before the last hyphen), then quantity values can be given manually.

Rough Table Structure
- NDC_Product ID PRODUCTID	PRODUCTNDC	NDCPACKAGECODE	PACKAGEDESCRIPTION
    - for opened things
- NDC_Package - ID  PRODUCTID PRODUCTNDC PRODUCTNDCPROPRIETARYNAME PROPRIETARYNAMESUFFIX NONPROPRIETARYNAME ACTIVE_NUMERATOR_STRENGTH	ACTIVE_INGRED_UNIT
    - for unopened things

- InventoryMed (id, ndc_id, quantity_initial, quantity_used)
    - Description would have to be something like 'PROPRIETARYNAME (NONPROPRIETARYNAME) ACTIVE_NUMERATOR_STRENGTH ACTIVE_INGRED_UNIT'
    - No relationships between ndc and inventorymed tables, the NDC ones would be used only for construction of an InventoryMed

custom meds can have 1+ ingredients though,
so just use what you've got to create the name.
